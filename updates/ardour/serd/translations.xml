        <Summary xml:lang="en">Serd is a lightweight C library for RDF syntax which supports reading and writing Turtle and NTriples.</Summary>
        <Description xml:lang="en">Serd is not intended to be a swiss-army knife of RDF syntax, but rather is suited to resource limited or performance critical applications (e.g. converting many gigabytes of NTriples to Turtle), or situations where a simple reader/writer with minimal dependencies is ideal (e.g. in LV2 implementations or embedded applications).</Description>
